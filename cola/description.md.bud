This is an empty project that provides link instructions for consumers
of the "dlfcn" on various platforms. It also provides the
`MULLE_RTLD_DEFAULT` define, which is what one generally wants to use when
looking up symbols with `dlysm`.

On Windows this will use [dlfcn-win32]() to supply `dlsym` and relatives.
